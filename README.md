# Steve Jobs Tribute Page

I decided to create a tribute page for Steve Jobs, as I find him an inspiring figure. 

This is not the first time I make a tribute page and I used the opportunity to practice some skills I learned in the last few days going through the tutorials sent to me by SchoolofCode. 
 
I especially focused on making the page look good through my new acquired skills in UX design, using the concepts of white space, visual hierarchy and alignment.

I also took the opportunity to practice responsive web design, making my page adapt to smaller screen sizes.

I am learning how to use Git and GitHub, and it is proving challenging, so I'd like to work on that more and become confident with it.
